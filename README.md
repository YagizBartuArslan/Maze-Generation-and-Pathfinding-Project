# Maze-Generation-and-Pathfinding-Project
This project is part of the CS300 course at Sabanci University. The goal is to create a program that generates random mazes of size MxN and finds the path between designated entry and exit points in the maze using a stack-based implementation. The project consists of two phases:  Maze generation Pathfinding in the generated maze
